title: Quick Sort
description: QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot, and then it partitions the given array around the picked pivot element. In quick sort, a large array is divided into two arrays in which one holds values that are smaller than the specified value (Pivot), and another array holds the values that are greater than the pivot. After that, left and right sub-arrays are also partitioned using the same approach. It will continue until the single element remains in the sub-array.

## Quick Sort

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot, and then it partitions the given array around the picked pivot element. In quick sort, a large array is divided into two arrays in which one holds values that are smaller than the specified value (Pivot), and another array holds the values that are greater than the pivot.

After that, left and right sub-arrays are also partitioned using the same approach. It will continue until the single element remains in the sub-array.
